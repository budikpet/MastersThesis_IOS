# Zoo Prague iOS application
An iOS and iPadOS application for visitors of Zoo Prague which is part of my Master's thesis. It uses data collected by the [created server](https://github.com/budikpet/MastersThesis_Server).

## Features
- Zoo Prague lexicon which contains information about all animals here.
    - can be filtered;
    - can be used to find a place where the animal is.
- A map of Zoo Prague which is integrated with the lexicon.
    - fully offline and constrained to Zoo Prague and surrounding area;
    - shows locations of animals;
    - makes it possible to navigate to a point on the map or a specific location.
